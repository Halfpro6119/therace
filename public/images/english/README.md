# English task images

Place the stimulus image for the description task here:

- **description-lagoon.png** – mountain lake / lagoon image for “Write a description suggested by this image” (L1-W01).

The app serves files from `public/` at the site root, so the task uses `/images/english/description-lagoon.png`.
