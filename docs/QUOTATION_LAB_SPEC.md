# Quotation Lab — Full Specification (Chunk 5)

**Purpose:** Turn knowledge into speed, control, flexibility, and examiner confidence.

Students should reach the point where:
- quotes come instantly
- analysis is selective, not bloated
- paragraphs are built deliberately
- panic disappears

---

## Part 1 — Quotation Lab (Core Engine)

### What the Quotation Lab IS

A curated, intelligent quote system, not a quote dump.

Each text / poem / cluster has:
- **12–20 high-value quotes only**
- each quote trained for **multiple themes**
- analysis guidance built into metadata

This trains thinking like an examiner, not memorising pages.

### Quote Object — Data Model (App-Ready)

Each quote is stored as:

```json
{
  "quote_id": "MACBETH-GUILT-03",
  "text": "Will all great Neptune's ocean wash this blood clean from my hand?",
  "source": "Macbeth",
  "act_scene_or_stanza": "Act 2 Scene 2",
  "themes": ["guilt", "conscience", "violence"],
  "methods": ["hyperbole", "imagery", "mythological allusion"],
  "coreMeaning": "Guilt is overwhelming and inescapable",
  "grade9Insight": "Guilt is framed as cosmic and irreversible",
  "contextHook": "Jacobean beliefs about sin and divine judgement",
  "bestUsedFor": [
    "guilt essays",
    "moral consequence arguments",
    "psychological collapse"
  ]
}
```

This metadata powers everything else in the Quotation Lab.

## Part 2 — Quotation Lab Modes (Student Experience)

### Mode 1: Understand the Quote

Student sees:
- quote
- **3 expandable panels:**
  - **Meaning** — core meaning
  - **Method → purpose** — how techniques serve the idea
  - **Context hook** — AO3 integration

**Goal:** comprehension, not memorisation.

### Mode 2: Select the Best Quote

**Prompt:** *Which quote best supports the idea that guilt is inescapable?*

Student:
- chooses from 4 quotes
- must **justify choice in 1 sentence**

**Examiner skill trained:** selectivity.

### Mode 3: Upgrade the Analysis

Student sees a weak response: *"This shows Macbeth feels guilty."*

**Task:** upgrade to Grade 6 → 8 → 9

**Rubric enforced:**
- add method
- add judgement
- avoid retelling

### Mode 4: Flexible Deployment

**Prompt:** *Use this quote to argue TWO different ideas.*

Example:
- guilt as punishment
- guilt as loss of masculinity

**This is Grade 9 behaviour.**

---

## Part 3 — Drill Engine (The Multiplier)

Short, repeatable drills (2–5 mins each).

### Drill 1: Explain in One Sentence

**Prompt:** *Explain how this quote links to power.*

**Rules:**
- max 20 words
- must include judgement

**Marks:** examiner-style feedback

### Drill 2: Finish the Analysis

**Given:** *"This suggests Macbeth's guilt is overwhelming because…"*

Student completes.

**Prevents:** vague endings, empty AO2.

### Drill 3: Link Two Quotes

**Prompt:** *Link one quote from Act 1 and one from Act 5 to show change.*

Students must:
- track development
- show structure awareness

### Drill 4: Which AO Is This?

Student labels: **AO1 / AO2 / AO3** — explains why.

**Builds examiner literacy.**

### Drill 5: Eliminate the Weak Quote

Student removes:
- overlong
- narrative
- irrelevant quotes

**This fixes one of the biggest Grade-7 ceilings.**

---

## Part 4 — Grade 9 Micro-Paragraph Builder

Bridges drills → full essays.

Student is given:
- question focus
- 1 quote
- 1 method

They must write **4–5 sentences** including:
- argument
- embedded quote
- AO2 purpose
- AO3 context
- judgement

### Auto-Feedback Checks

- quotation length
- relevance
- method-purpose link
- conceptual depth

---

## Part 5 — Progress & Heatmaps

Per student, per text:
- **quote familiarity heatmap**
- **theme confidence map**
- **AO balance tracker**
- **grade ceiling indicator**

Example:

> ⚠️ Strong AO1 & AO2  
> 🔻 AO3 underused → Grade 8 ceiling

---

## Part 6 — Examiner Intelligence Layer (AI)

AI feedback uses examiner language, not generic praise:

- *"This analysis identifies method but lacks purpose."*
- *"Context is relevant but not integrated."*
- *"This is descriptive, not analytical."*

Aligned directly to mark schemes.
