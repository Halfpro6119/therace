| Quick checks | 17 | 120+ (3–5 per sub-topic) | 100+ missing |
| Case studies | 2 | 15–20 | 13–18 missing |
| Calculation tasks | 6 | 8+ | 2 missing (break-even) |
| Evaluation prompts | 5 | 15+ | 10+ missing |

**Critical gaps:** 3.2.4 Globalisation, 3.2.5 Legislation, 3.3.2 Procurement, 3.3.4 Customer service, 3.4.3 Motivation, 3.4.4 Training, 3.5.1–3.5.3 (Marketing fundamentals), break-even interpretation.

### 1.6 Unit 3.6 — Finance (Paper 2 only)

- **Glossary:** Overdraft, trade credit, hire purchase, ARR (average rate of return), income statement, statement of financial position, assets, liabilities
- **Quick check:** 3.6.3 (none)
- **Calculation:** **Break-even interpretation** — AQA requires students to interpret break-even charts (identify break-even output, margin of safety); we have no `breakEvenInterpret` task. Spec says: *Students will not be expected to draw break-even charts or use the break-even formula.* So we need interpretation-only tasks.

---

## 2. Calculation Coverage (AQA Requirement)

AQA 3.6.3 & 3.1.7 require:

| Calculation | Spec requirement | Current | Status |
|-------------|------------------|---------|--------|
| Revenue, costs, profit, loss | Calculate from figures | ✅ revenueCostProfit | Covered |
| Average unit cost | Calculate and interpret | ✅ unitCost | Covered |
| Cash flow | Complete/interpret forecast | ✅ cashFlow | Covered |
| Average rate of return | Calculate for investment | ✅ averageRateOfReturn | Covered |
| Break-even | **Interpret** charts (identify break-even output, margin of safety) | ❌ None | **Missing** |
| Gross profit margin | Calculate and interpret | ✅ grossProfitMargin | Covered |
| Net profit margin | Calculate and interpret | ✅ netProfitMargin | Covered |

**Action:** Add at least one `breakEvenInterpret` task: scenario + given chart/data → identify break-even output and margin of safety → interpret.

---

## 3. Case Study Coverage

**Paper split:** Paper 1 = 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, 3.4 | Paper 2 = 3.1, 3.2, 3.5, 3.6

| Unit | Paper 1 | Paper 2 | Current case studies |
|------|---------|---------|----------------------|
| 3.1 | ✅ | ✅ | Café (P1), TechGadgets (P2) |
| 3.2 | ✅ | ✅ | Both |
| 3.3 | ✅ | — | Café only |
| 3.4 | ✅ | — | **None** |
| 3.5 | — | ✅ | TechGadgets only |
| 3.6 | — | ✅ | TechGadgets only |

**Gaps:**
- **3.4 (HR):** No case study for Paper 1
- **3.5 (Marketing):** Only one shared case; need more marketing-focused cases
- **3.6 (Finance):** Only one shared case; need more finance-focused cases
- **Implementation plan:** 3–4 case studies per paper; we have 1 per paper

---

## 4. Evaluation Prompt Coverage

3. **Add quick checks for 3.1.3, 3.1.5** and all sub-topics with zero coverage

### P1 — High impact

4. **Add 30+ essential glossary terms** — prioritise: not-for-profit, plc, merger, takeover, franchise, interest rate, exchange rate, NMW, Equality Act, HASAWA, job production, flow production, lean production, JIC, job description, person specification, primary/secondary research, pricing methods, Boston Matrix

## 7. Summary Table

| Unit | Concepts | Glossary | Quick Check | Case Study | Calc | Eval |
|------|----------|----------|-------------|------------|------|------|
| 3.1 | 7/7 ✅ | 12/25 ⚠️ | 6/25 ⚠️ | 2 ✅ | 2/2 ✅ | 2/4 ⚠️ |
| 3.2 | 4/6 ⚠️ | 3/20 ⚠️ | 2/20 ⚠️ | 2 ✅ | — | 1/3 ⚠️ |
| 3.3 | 2/4 ⚠️ | 2/15 ⚠️ | 2/15 ⚠️ | 1 ⚠️ | — | 0/3 ❌ |
| 3.4 | 2/4 ⚠️ | 3/15 ⚠️ | 1/15 ⚠️ | 0 ❌ | — | 0/3 ❌ |
| 3.5 | 1/4 ⚠️ | 3/30 ⚠️ | 1/25 ⚠️ | 1 ⚠️ | — | 0/3 ❌ |
| 3.6 | 3/4 ⚠️ | 5/25 ⚠️ | 4/20 ⚠️ | 1 ⚠️ | 4/5 ⚠️ | 2/2 ✅ |
| **Total** | **19/29** | **28/130** | **16/120** | **7/15** | **6/7** | **5/18** |

**Conclusion:** The Business Hub covers the structure of the specification but needs substantial content expansion to ensure students are fully prepared for every topic AQA will test. The highest-impact work is: concepts for uncovered sub-topics, break-even interpretation, essential glossary terms, and case studies for HR and Marketing/Finance.
