## 3. Design Principles for Effective & Engaging Learning

- **Align with AQA:** Every activity maps to spec content and to AO1/AO2/AO3. Research methods and mathematical skills woven throughout.
- **Option-aware:** Students study one topic from each of Options 1, 2, 3. The hub must let users select their three options and filter content accordingly.
- **Research-led:** Psychology depends on named studies (Milgram, Asch, Bowlby, Pavlov, Bandura, etc.). Learning modes must emphasise study design, findings, strengths, limitations.
- **Evaluation practice:** AO3 is heavily weighted. Activities must practise: “evaluate”, “assess”, “compare and contrast”, “discuss strengths and limitations”.
- **Approaches link:** Issues and debates connect to all topics. Students must apply nature-nurture, reductionism, etc. to their chosen option topics.
- **Reuse app patterns:** Mirror Science Lab / Business Hub / History Hub: concept → flashcard → check → questions; progress and gating; config-driven content.

---

## 4. Proposed Learning Hub: “Psychology Hub”

- **Entry:** From Subjects page, “Psychology” links to `/psychology-hub` (new hub). Psychology is in `CHOSEN_SUBJECT_NAMES`; add dedicated hub and route in line with Business Hub.
- **Option selection:** On first use (or in settings), user picks: Option 1 topic (Relationships/Gender/Cognition and development), Option 2 topic (Schizophrenia/Eating behaviour/Stress), Option 3 topic (Aggression/Forensic/Addiction). Content and revision map filter to these three options plus all compulsory content.
- **Learning modes:** Concept first, then key studies & terms (flashcards), then evaluation / comparison skills, then exam-style questions (short answer, extended writing).
- **Research methods:** Integrated into content topics where relevant; plus dedicated Research Methods Lab for systematic practice.

---

## 5. Learning Modes (Effective & Engaging)

### 5.1 Concept Lab (Learn)

- **Purpose:** Build understanding before terminology and exam-style questions.
- **Content per concept:** Core idea (1–3 sentences); key studies (name, procedure, findings in brief); link to approach (e.g. “This uses the behavioural approach because…”); common misconception; “How would you evaluate this?”
- **Format:** Card or short page per concept; link to related topics and to flashcards/questions.
- **Coverage:** At least one concept per sub-topic across all compulsory and chosen option topics.
- **Engagement:** Real-world scenarios (“A friend is scared of dogs. Which approach would explain this?”); “Apply this to…” prompts.

### 5.2 Key Studies & Glossary (Flashcard Mode)

- **Purpose:** Secure AO1: named studies, key terms, researchers, procedures, findings.
- **Content:** Study → researcher, aim, procedure, findings, conclusion; Term → definition; optional “in context” sentence; link to topic.
- **Modes:** Classic flip card; “name the researcher” or “match study to finding”; confidence rating for spaced repetition.
- **Coverage:** Full spec for compulsory topics; full spec for chosen option topics. Include: Milgram, Asch, Lorenz, Harlow, Bowlby, Ainsworth, Pavlov, Skinner, Bandura, Beck, Ellis, etc.
- **Engagement:** Group by paper and topic; “Exam tip” for studies that often appear in 16-mark essays.

### 5.3 Quick Check (Micro-Assessments)

- **Purpose:** Check recall before unlocking evaluation and extended writing.
- **Formats:**  
  - Multiple choice (definition, “which study…”, “which approach…”).  
  - True/False.  
  - Short answer (“Who conducted the obedience study?” → “Milgram”).  
  - Drag-and-drop (order stages of systematic desensitisation; match study to topic).  
  - “Which two of the following…” (AO1/AO2).
- **Coverage:** 5–10 items per topic across compulsory and chosen options.
- **Gating:** Unlock Evaluation Lab and Question Lab per topic when Quick Check passed (e.g. ≥70%).

### 5.4 Study Evaluator (AO3 — Strengths & Limitations)

- **Purpose:** Practise AO3: strengths, limitations, comparison across studies/approaches.
- **Content:** Study or theory prompt; structured support: “One strength…”; “One limitation…”; “Conclusion…”. Model answers with AO3 wording highlighted.
- **Format:** Structured form or free text with model answer and mark-scheme breakdown.
- **Coverage:** Key studies and theories per topic; at least 2–3 evaluator prompts per topic.
- **Engagement:** “Compare X and Y”; “Evaluate the evidence for…”; link to Issues and Debates.

### 5.5 Issues and Debates Lab (AO3 — Cross-Topic)

- **Purpose:** Apply issues and debates to content studied elsewhere.
- **Content:** Prompt (e.g. “Discuss the nature-nurture debate in relation to attachment”); structured plan: nature side, nurture side, interactionist; model answer.
- **Coverage:** Each issue/debate applied to at least 2–3 compulsory topics and to each chosen option topic.
- **Engagement:** “Which approach is most reductionist? Why?”; “How might gender bias affect research into…?”

### 5.6 Research Methods Lab

- **Purpose:** Systematic practice of research methods, design, data handling, inferential testing.
- **Content:**  
  - **Design:** Given scenario → identify IV/DV, suggest design, operationalise, identify extraneous variables.  
  - **Methods:** Match method to scenario; strengths/limitations.  
  - **Data:** Interpret bar chart, scattergram; calculate mean, median, mode; identify level of measurement.  
  - **Inferential:** When to use sign test, Spearman, etc.; interpret significance.
- **Coverage:** All methods, scientific processes, data handling, inferential tests from spec.
- **Engagement:** “Design a study to test…”; “What statistical test would you use?”

### 5.7 Question Lab (Short Answer & Extended Writing)

- **Purpose:** Exam-style AO1+AO2+AO3 practice.
- **Content:**  
  - **Short answer:** 2–4 marks (define, outline, describe).  
  - **Outline:** 6 marks (outline X and Y).  
  - **Discuss:** 8 marks (discuss X; include strengths/limitations).  
  - **Extended:** 16 marks (e.g. “Discuss explanations for obedience” — plan, paragraphs, conclusion). Mark scheme: idea marks, knowledge, application, evaluation.
- **Format:** Structured form or free text with model answer and mark-scheme breakdown.
- **Coverage:** At least one of each question type per topic; 16-mark prompts covering all compulsory and chosen option topics.
- **Engagement:** “Method mark” style feedback (Science Lab pattern); prompts to include evaluation.

### 5.8 Topic Overview & Revision Map

- **Purpose:** Show coverage at a glance; “your options” and “what’s next” per paper/topic.
- **Content:** For each paper: topics list with status (Concept, Key Studies, Quick Check, Study Evaluator, Issues and Debates, Question Lab). Progress bars per paper and overall.
- **Engagement:** “Recommended next”: e.g. “Complete Quick Check for Memory to unlock Question Lab.”

## 9. Engagement Tactics (Summary)

- **Real-world hooks:** “A friend says they can’t remember their holiday. Which theory of forgetting applies?”; “Your school wants to reduce bullying. Use social influence research to suggest…”
- **Study-centred:** Named studies (Milgram, Asch, etc.) are memorable; use them as anchors for concepts and evaluation.
- **Approaches thread:** Link every topic to an approach (behaviourist, cognitive, biological, etc.) so students see the “big picture.”
- **Issues and debates:** Explicitly apply nature-nurture, reductionism, etc. to content so Paper 3 Section A feels connected.
- **Evaluation muscle:** AO3 is ~36–38%. Every mode should include “evaluate”, “discuss strengths”, “compare”.
- **Clear path:** “Concept → Key Studies → Quick Check → Study Evaluator → Question Lab” visible in UI; gating so harder tasks unlock after basics.
- **Option ownership:** “Your three options” visible everywhere; no irrelevant content.
- **Varied formats:** Mix timeline-style (e.g. procedure order), flashcards, MC, drag-and-drop, short answer, extended writing; avoid monotony.
- **Research methods integration:** Don’t isolate research methods; weave design and evaluation into content topics (e.g. “Evaluate the methodology of Milgram’s study”).
