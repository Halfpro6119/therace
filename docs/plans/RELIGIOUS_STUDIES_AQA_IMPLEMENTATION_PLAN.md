## 3. Design Principles for Effective & Engaging Learning

- **Align with AQA:** Every activity should map to spec content and to AO1 (knowledge) and AO2 (analysis/evaluation). The 1–2–4–5–12 question structure must be practised explicitly.
- **Option-aware:** Students study two religions and four themes (or two themes + two textual). The hub must let users select their religions and themes and filter content accordingly.
- **Contrasting views:** Spec requires "contrasting beliefs" and "common and divergent views within and/or between religions." Learning modes must include comparison cards, "explain two contrasting beliefs," and "evaluate" practice.
- **Sources of wisdom:** Students must refer to scripture and sacred texts. Flashcards and questions should include scripture references; "quote and explain" practice is essential.
- **12-mark essay craft:** The 12-mark question requires: two sides or two religions; references to scripture; analysis; evaluation; conclusion. Structured practice: plan → two views → evaluation → conclusion.
- **Ethical and philosophical reasoning:** Themes A–F require ethical arguments (sanctity of life, quality of life, utility, etc.). Theme C requires philosophical arguments (Design, First Cause, problem of evil).
- **Reuse app patterns:** Mirror Science Lab / Business Hub / History Hub: concept → flashcard → check → questions; progress and gating; config-driven content.

---

## 4. Proposed Learning Hub: "Religious Studies Hub"

- **Entry:** From Subjects page, "Religious Studies" links to `/religious-studies-hub` (new hub). Add Religious Studies to `subjectGroups.ts` as a featured hub (currently in `CHOSEN_SUBJECT_NAMES`).
- **Option selection:** On first use (or in settings), user picks: two religions (non-prohibited combination); four themes (A–F) OR two themes + textual studies (G, H).
- **Learning modes:** Beliefs first (concepts), then key terms and scripture (flashcards), then contrasting views, then exam-style questions (1–2–4–5–12). Textual route: passage study + significance questions.

---

## 5. Learning Modes (Effective & Engaging)

### 5.1 Belief Lab (Learn)

- **Purpose:** Build understanding of beliefs and teachings before terminology and exam questions.
- **Content per belief:** Core idea (1–2 sentences); optional visual (e.g. Four Noble Truths diagram, Trinity diagram); common misconception; "How does this influence…?" (individuals, communities, societies).
- **Format:** Card or short page per belief; link to related practices and to flashcards.
- **Coverage:** At least one concept per belief sub-topic for each religion; key beliefs for each theme.
- **Engagement:** "Why might a Buddhist and a Christian disagree about…?" links; scripture callouts.

### 5.2 Scripture & Key Terms (Flashcards)

- **Purpose:** Secure AO1: key terms, scripture references, definitions.
- **Content:** Term → definition; scripture reference → teaching; "in context" sentence; link to religion/theme.
- **Modes:** Classic flip card; "match term–definition"; "match scripture–teaching"; confidence rating for spaced repetition.
- **Coverage:** Full spec glossary per religion; key scripture passages (e.g. Qur'an 112, Genesis 1:1–3, Dhammapada 190–191, John 1:1–3); theme terminology (just war, sanctity of life, etc.).
- **Engagement:** Group by religion and theme; "Exam tip" for terms that appear in 2- and 4-mark answers.

### 5.3 Contrasting Views Lab

- **Purpose:** Practise "explain two contrasting beliefs" (4- and 5-mark questions).
- **Content:** Issue (e.g. "contraception," "abortion," "death penalty") → two religious views with scripture; structured prompt: "One belief… Another belief…"
- **Format:** Card with issue; two columns or two cards; model answer with marking breakdown.
- **Coverage:** Every theme's "contrasting beliefs" requirements; common and divergent views within each religion (e.g. Sunni vs Shi'a on imamate; Protestant vs Catholic on Eucharist).
- **Engagement:** "Drag to match religion–view"; "Which scripture supports this view?"

### 5.4 Quick Check (Micro-Assessments)

- **Purpose:** Check recall before unlocking extended questions.
- **Formats:**
  - Multiple choice (key term, "which religion teaches…", "which scripture…").
  - True/False.
  - Short answer: "Give one belief about…" (1-mark style).
  - "Which two of the following…" (2-mark style).
  - Match: religion–belief; theme–issue; scripture–teaching.
- **Coverage:** 5–10 items per religion sub-topic; 5–10 per theme sub-topic.
- **Gating:** Unlock Question Lab per religion/theme when Quick Check passed (e.g. ≥70%).

### 5.5 Short Answer Lab (1, 2, 4, 5 marks)

- **Purpose:** Practise the exact question types: 1-mark (one belief), 2-mark (two beliefs), 4-mark (contrasting beliefs), 5-mark (explain with reference). Mark-scheme-style feedback.
- **Content:**
  - 1-mark: "Give one belief about…" — one clear point.
  - 2-mark: "Give two beliefs…" — two distinct points.
  - 4-mark: "Explain two contrasting beliefs…" — two religions or two views, with development.
  - 5-mark: "Explain two beliefs… with reference to scripture" — two beliefs, reference, explanation.
- **Format:** Question + text area; model answer; mark-scheme breakdown (what gains 1, 2, 3, 4 marks).
- **Coverage:** At least 3–5 of each question type per religion; 3–5 per theme.

### 5.6 Extended Writing Lab (12 marks)

- **Purpose:** Practise 12-mark evaluation: "Evaluate this statement. In your answer you should refer to [religion] and [religion] or religious and non-religious views."
- **Content:** Statement (e.g. "Religious believers should not use contraception"); prompt for two sides; structured support: "One view… Another view… Evaluation… Conclusion."
- **Format:** Writing area with word guidance; plan box (optional); model answer with AO1/AO2 breakdown; SPaG reminder.
- **Coverage:** At least 2–3 12-mark prompts per religion; 2–3 per theme.
- **Engagement:** "Two religions" or "religious and non-religious" clearly signposted; factor comparison (e.g. "most important reason").

### 5.7 Philosophical Arguments Lab (Theme C)

- **Purpose:** Theme C requires philosophical arguments for/against God: Design, First Cause, miracles, evil and suffering, science.
- **Content:** Each argument with premises, strengths, weaknesses; "Evaluate" prompts.
- **Format:** Card per argument; "strengths" and "weaknesses" toggle; comparison table; 12-mark practice.
- **Coverage:** Design argument; First Cause; argument from miracles (one example); evil and suffering; science vs God.

### 5.8 Textual Studies Lab (Themes G & H)

- **Purpose:** For textual route: study set passages from St Mark's Gospel; understand significance for Jesus, early followers, 21st-century Christians.
- **Content:** Passage text; questions on meaning, significance, differing interpretations; links to titles (Son of Man, etc.), Kingdom of God, discipleship.
- **Format:** Passage display + comprehension-style questions; "How might a Christian interpret this today?"; 12-mark on authority of Gospel.
- **Coverage:** All set passages for Themes G and H; significance questions per section.

### 5.9 Topic Overview & Revision Map

- **Purpose:** Show coverage at a glance; "your religions" and "your themes"; progress per section.
- **Content:** Two religions + four themes (or two + G, H); status per section (Belief Lab, Flashcards, Quick Check, Short Answer, Extended Writing). Progress bars per religion and per theme.
- **Engagement:** "Recommended next": e.g. "Complete Quick Check for Islam to unlock Question Lab."

| **10** | Polish: revision map "next step," accessibility, teacher view | Production-ready |

---

## 9. Engagement Tactics (Summary)

- **Beliefs first:** Build understanding before terminology; "Why does this matter?" links to practices and themes.
- **Scripture at the heart:** Every belief linked to source; "quote and explain" practised repeatedly.
- **Contrasting views everywhere:** Comparison is central to the spec; "Religion X says… Religion Y says…" in every mode.
- **Clear question structure:** 1–2–4–5–12 visible in UI; mark-scheme breakdown so students learn what examiners want.
- **Option ownership:** "Your two religions" and "Your four themes" visible; no irrelevant content.
- **Ethical reasoning:** Themes A–F use ethical arguments; show "sanctity of life," "quality of life," "utility" explicitly.
- **Philosophy made accessible:** Theme C arguments (Design, First Cause, evil) with clear strengths/weaknesses; avoid jargon.
- **Varied formats:** Flashcards, MC, match, short answer, extended writing; avoid monotony.
- **SPaG visibility:** Remind students of SPaG marks in 12-mark questions; link to mark descriptors.
