## 3. Design Principles for Effective & Engaging Learning

- **Align with AQA:** Every activity should map to spec content and to AO1/AO2/AO3/AO4 as appropriate. Second-order concepts (cause, consequence, change, continuity, significance, similarity, difference) must be practised explicitly.
- **Option-aware:** Students study one period, one wider world depth, one thematic, one British depth. The hub must let users select their four options (or default to a common combination) and filter content accordingly.
- **Source and interpretation practice:** Paper 1 has heavy AO3/AO4 (sources and interpretations). Learning modes must include source utility, “how far do you agree” with interpretations, and “how convincing.”
- **Essay craft:** Describe two features, “in what ways,” write an account, and essay (factors/judgement) need structured practice: plan → paragraphs → judgement; idea marks vs knowledge vs analysis.
- **Narrative and chronology:** Depth and period studies rely on secure chronology and narrative. Timelines, key-date recall, and “write an account” practice are essential.
- **Historic environment:** British depth Q4 is tied to a specified site (rotated annually, published in advance). Content should support “site + wider context” and second-order concepts in that context.
- **Reuse app patterns:** Mirror Science Lab / Maths Mastery / Business Hub: concept → flashcard → check → questions; progress and gating; config-driven content.

---

## 4. Proposed Learning Hub: “History Hub”

- **Entry:** From Subjects page, “History” could link to `/history-hub` (new hub). History is already in `CHOSEN_SUBJECT_NAMES` and `gcseScope`; add a dedicated hub and route in line with Business Hub.
- **Option selection:** On first use (or in settings), user picks: Period study (AA/AB/AC/AD), Wider world depth (BA–BE), Thematic (AA/BB/AC), British depth (BA–BD). Content and revision map filter to these four options only.
- **Learning modes:** Concept/narrative first, then key people/dates/terms (flashcards), then source/interpretation skills, then exam-style questions (describe, explain, account, essay). Historic environment as a distinct sub-mode for British depth.

---

## 5. Learning Modes (Effective & Engaging)

### 5.1 Timeline & Narrative (Learn)

- **Purpose:** Build chronological and narrative understanding before tackling sources and essays.
- **Content per option/part:** Timeline of key events; 2–4 sentence “story” for each key development; “What happened next?” and “What caused X?” links.
- **Format:** Scrollable timeline; expandable cards per event; optional “reorder these events” and “match cause–consequence” drag-and-drop.
- **Coverage:** Every part of the four chosen options; British depth Parts 1–3 plus historic environment summary.
- **Engagement:** Visual timeline; short “story” hooks; links to Key Terms and Source Lab.

### 5.2 Key Terms & Flashcards

- **Purpose:** Secure AO1 (knowledge of key features and characteristics): dates, people, treaties, laws, key phrases.
- **Content:** Term → definition and/or date; “in context” sentence; link to option/part. Include second-order vocabulary (cause, consequence, continuity, change, significance).
- **Modes:** Classic flip card; “type the term” or “match term–definition”; confidence rating for spaced repetition.
- **Coverage:** Full spec glossary per chosen options (e.g. Reichstag Fire, Enabling Act, Dawes Plan, Marshall Plan, Magna Carta, suffrage, Germ Theory, etc.).
- **Engagement:** Group by option and part; “Exam tip” for terms that often appear in describe/explain answers.

### 5.3 Concept Cards (Second-Order Concepts)

- **Purpose:** Practise cause, consequence, change, continuity, significance, similarity, difference in context.
- **Content:** Short scenario or statement (e.g. “The Treaty of Versailles contributed to the collapse of the Weimar Republic”); prompt “Identify one cause and one consequence”; or “What changed and what stayed the same between 1924 and 1929 in Germany?”
- **Format:** Card with scenario + structured short answer (dropdown or free text with model answer).
- **Coverage:** At least 2–3 concept cards per part across the four options.
- **Engagement:** Link to Timeline and to Source/Interpretation Lab.

### 5.4 Quick Check (Micro-Assessments)

- **Purpose:** Check recall and simple application before unlocking source/essay practice.
- **Formats:**  
  - Multiple choice (key date, key person, “which treaty…”, “what was the main cause…”).  
  - True/False.  
  - Short “one phrase” or “one date” (e.g. “In which year did Hitler become Chancellor?”).  
  - Drag-and-drop: order events; match event to consequence; match factor to development (thematic).  
  - “Which two of the following…” (AO1/AO2).
- **Coverage:** 5–10 items per part per option.
- **Gating:** Unlock Source Lab and Question Lab per option/part when Quick Check passed (e.g. ≥70% or “all correct once”).

### 5.5 Source Lab (AO3)

- **Purpose:** Practise “how useful” and source analysis in the style of Paper 1 Section B and Paper 2 Section A.
- **Content:** One or two sources (written or visual) with provenance; question “How useful is Source A for…?” or “What can you learn from Source B about…?”. Mark-scheme-style breakdown: content, provenance, context, limitation.
- **Coverage:**  
  - Paper 1 depth: 2–3 source sets per part (written + visual).  
  - Paper 2 thematic: 2–3 source questions per part.  
  - British depth: interpretation “how far do you agree” (AO4) — see Interpretation Lab.
- **Engagement:** Variety of source types; “What would make this source more useful?” follow-up.

### 5.6 Interpretation Lab (AO4)

- **Purpose:** Practise “how do interpretations differ?”, “why do they differ?”, “how convincing?” (Paper 1 Period) and “how far do you agree?” (Paper 2 British depth).
- **Content:** Two short interpretations (50–100 words) with ascription; questions 1–3 style (differ, why differ, how convincing) or single interpretation + “how far do you agree?”. Model answers with AO4 wording.
- **Coverage:** Period study: 2–3 interpretation sets per part; British depth: 2–3 “how far agree” questions per part.
- **Engagement:** Link to Key Terms (provenance, purpose) and to Timeline (context).

### 5.7 Question Lab (Describe, Explain, Account, Essay)

- **Purpose:** Exam-style AO1+AO2 practice: describe two features, in what ways… explain, write an account, essay (factors/judgement).
- **Content:**  
  - **Describe:** “Describe two key features of…” — mark scheme: 2× (feature + support).  
  - **Explain:** “In what ways were X affected by Y? Explain your answer.” — AO1+AO2.  
  - **Account:** “Write an account of…” (cause/consequence narrative) — AO1+AO2.  
  - **Essay:** “How far do you agree…?” / “[Factor] was the most important. How far do you agree?” — plan, paragraphs, judgement; idea + knowledge + analysis. For factor-evaluation essays, the **Factor Essay Planning Triangle** (5.7a) is shown: question factor in the centre, three factors in the corners (user plans and annotates), and the plan remains visible and editable throughout the writing task.
- **Format:** Structured form or free text with word limit; model answer and mark-scheme breakdown (idea marks, knowledge, analysis). Factor essays: triangle + writing area; plan and draft saved together.
- **Coverage:** At least one of each question type per part for each chosen option; essay prompts covering all parts and factor questions for thematic.
- **Engagement:** “Method mark” style feedback (Science Lab pattern); SPaG reminder for essay questions that carry SPaG marks. For **factor essays** (e.g. Paper 2 Section A Q4), use the **Factor Essay Planning Triangle** (see 5.7a).

### 5.7a Factor Essay Planning Triangle

- **Purpose:** Support factor-evaluation essays (e.g. “War was the most important factor in the development of medicine. How far do you agree?”) by giving students a visual plan: the question’s factor in the centre and three other factors in the corners of a triangle, with space to annotate each. The plan stays visible and editable for the whole writing task so they can refine it as they write.
- **Layout:**
  - **Centre of triangle:** The factor from the question (e.g. “War” or “Science and technology”) — read-only, set by the question.
  - **Three corners:** One factor per corner (e.g. “Government”, “Religion”, “Role of the individual”). Each corner is an editable field: factor name + optional short annotation (bullet points, key evidence, or link to period).
- **Behaviour:**
  - **Planning phase:** Before or at the start of the task, the user fills the three corners (factor labels and any annotations). They can use spec factors (war, religion, chance, government, communication, science and technology, role of the individual) or their own.
  - **During writing:** The triangle is shown alongside the essay answer (e.g. sticky panel to the side or collapsible panel above/beside the text area). User can **look back at the plan at any time** and **change it** (edit corner factors or annotations) without leaving the writing view. Changes are saved with the draft so the plan and answer stay in sync.
  - **Optional:** “Copy factor to paragraph” or “Focus on this factor” to help structure paragraphs; or a simple reminder like “You planned 3 factors – have you compared each to the question factor?”
- **Coverage:** Used for every factor-essay prompt in Question Lab (thematic Q4-style and any “evaluate factor” essay). One triangle per factor question; state (centre + three corners + annotations) persisted per question or per session.
- **Engagement:** Visual structure reduces planning anxiety; editable-at-any-time plan mirrors exam conditions where students can revisit their plan; annotations give a quick “evidence hook” for each factor while writing.

### 5.8 Historic Environment (British Depth Only)

- **Purpose:** Support the British depth Q4 essay: site in its historical context, second-order concepts, connection to wider events.
- **Content:** Per specified site (when known): location, function, structure, people, design, culture/values, links to depth study events. “How does this site show change/continuity/cause/consequence?” Prompts updated when AQA rotates the site (published 3 years ahead).
- **Format:** Short reading + 1–2 practice essay questions linking site to Part 1/2/3 content.
- **Coverage:** One current specified site per British depth option; note in app that site changes annually and to check aqa.org.uk/history.

### 5.9 Topic Overview & Revision Map

- **Purpose:** Show coverage at a glance; “your options” and “what’s next” per option/part.
- **Content:** For each of the four chosen options: parts list with status (Timeline, Key Terms, Quick Check, Source Lab, Interpretation Lab, Question Lab, Historic Environment where applicable). Progress bars per option and per paper.
- **Engagement:** “Recommended next”: e.g. “Complete Quick Check for Germany Part 2 to unlock Question Lab.”

| **9** | Polish: revision map “next step”, SPaG callouts on essay questions, accessibility, any teacher/admin view | Production-ready |

---

## 9. Engagement Tactics (Summary)

- **Stories and chronology:** Timeline and narrative first so that sources and essays have a clear context.  
- **Option ownership:** “Your four options” visible everywhere; no irrelevant content.  
- **Second-order concepts:** Explicit concept cards and essay prompts so cause, consequence, change, continuity, significance, similarity, difference become familiar.  
- **Source and interpretation variety:** Mix written and visual sources; different provenances; “how useful” and “how convincing” practised repeatedly.  
- **Mark-scheme visibility:** Show “content mark,” “provenance,” “context,” “idea + knowledge + analysis” so students learn what examiners look for.  
- **Clear path:** “Timeline → Key Terms → Quick Check → Source/Interpretation/Question Lab” visible in UI; gating so harder tasks unlock after basics.  
- **Historic environment:** One focused “site + wider context” experience per British depth; note when AQA changes the site.  
- **Varied formats:** Mix timeline, flashcards, MC, drag-and-drop, short answer, source analysis, essay; avoid monotony.  
- **Factor planning triangle:** For factor essays, the triangle (question factor in centre, 3 factors in corners, annotate and edit anytime while writing) keeps planning visible and reduces “blank page” anxiety; students can refine the plan as they write.

*This plan gives a complete map from the AQA History 8145 topic list and assessment structure to a structured, engaging History Hub that covers all test topics (for the student’s chosen four options), aligns with AO1–AO4 and second-order concepts, and reuses the app’s existing patterns (Science Lab, Business Hub, config-driven content, progress and gating).*
