## How marking works (use across ALL tasks)

### AO5 (24 marks): Content & Organisation

Examiners reward:

- **Clear purpose** (what you're trying to achieve)
- **Shaped content** (not random ideas)
- **Paragraphing with intent**
- **Structural control** (shifts, pacing, focus, endings)

### AO6 (16 marks): Technical accuracy

Examiners reward:

- **Sentence control** (variety + accuracy)
- **Punctuation used deliberately** (not just correct)
- **Vocabulary precision**
- **Spelling accuracy**

### Bands (simple but accurate)

| Grade | AO5 / AO6 |
|-------|------------|
| **Grade 4** | Clear, simple, some organisation; mostly correct SPaG |
| **Grade 6** | Deliberate paragraphs, some crafted language; generally accurate |
| **Grade 8** | Controlled structure, deliberate effects; confident accuracy |
| **Grade 9** | Crafted voice, sophisticated structural shaping; precision + flair without chaos |

# TASK 1 — Description suggested by an image (45 mins)

*(Image attached in-app.)*

## Mark scheme guide (AO5 / AO6)

- **Grade 4 target:** clear description, basic imagery, some paragraphs
- **Grade 6 target:** consistent viewpoint, developed atmosphere, varied sentences
- **Grade 8 target:** zooming structure, deliberate shift, crafted imagery + rhythm
- **Grade 9 target:** "writer's voice", layered meanings, structural artistry (contrast, motif, circular ending)

## Top-band checklist (tickable)

**Atmosphere & focus**

- [ ] I establish mood in the first 2 sentences
- [ ] I keep a consistent viewpoint (observer / character / camera)
- [ ] I zoom in on 2–3 small details (micro focus)

**Language**

- [ ] I use precise verbs (not "went / got / saw")
- [ ] I use 2+ sensory channels (sound / touch / smell)
- [ ] I use figurative language that fits the mood (not random)

**Structure**

- [ ] My paragraphs change focus or time (not just "new line")
- [ ] I include a deliberate shift (calm→unease / bright→grey / distant→close)
- [ ] My final line feels controlled (echoes a motif / reveals a final image)

**AO6**

- [ ] I include at least 1 colon or dash used correctly
- [ ] I vary sentence lengths (short punch → longer flow)
- [ ] I proofread spellings of ambitious words

## Step-by-step method

**0–5 min (Plan with a camera):**

- Choose 3 "camera shots": wide shot, mid shot, close-up
- Pick a mood word (e.g. unease, nostalgia, isolation)
- Pick a motif to repeat (e.g. light, silence, rust, footprints)

**5–35 min (Write in 4 paragraphs):**

1. Hook + wide shot (mood + big picture)
2. Mid shot (details + texture)
3. Close-up (1 object becomes symbolic)
4. Shift / ending (change or reveal; echo motif)

**35–45 min (Upgrade pass):**

- Replace 5 weak verbs
- Add 1 structural shift line: "At first… / Now… / Then…"
- Add one intentional punctuation moment (colon / dash)

## Model answers

### Grade 4 (simple but clear)

The picture shows a quiet place. The sky looks dull and everything seems empty. The buildings look old and the ground looks worn, like people used to walk there but don't anymore.

There is not much colour and it makes the place feel cold. You can imagine the air being chilly and still. Nothing is moving and it feels like time has stopped.

In the distance everything looks the same, which makes it look lonely. The image feels peaceful but also a bit sad, because there are no people and no noise.

It looks like a place that has been left behind.

---

### Grade 6 (developed atmosphere + control)

The image captures a place that feels paused. A pale sky hangs over the scene, washing colour from the buildings and leaving them faint and tired-looking. The ground is marked and uneven, as if it remembers footsteps that no longer arrive.

There is a strange stillness to it. The air feels cold, and the silence is noticeable, not comforting. Even the edges of the buildings look worn, softened by time and weather.

Further back, the scene stretches away without change, which makes it feel distant and lonely. You get the sense that this place once mattered, but now it has been forgotten.

It isn't dramatic or loud. It's quiet in a way that makes you look closer.

---

### Grade 8 (zooming + deliberate shift)

The scene is drained of warmth. Above it, the sky sits low and colourless, pressing down on the empty space like a lid. From far away, the place seems ordinary—just buildings, ground, distance—until the silence makes it feel unnatural.

Move closer and the details begin to speak. The surfaces look scuffed and tired; edges are chipped, paint is dulled, lines are softened. The ground is not clean but not messy either—simply used, then abandoned. It feels as if the place has been waiting, patient, for people who stopped coming.

Then the mood shifts. What first looked peaceful becomes uneasy. When nothing moves, the mind invents movement. You start to imagine sounds that aren't there: a door that creaks, a step that echoes.

And the quiet remains—thick, watchful—holding its breath.

---

### Grade 9 (crafted voice + motif + circular ending)

Silence isn't empty here; it has weight. It settles across the image, filling corners and cracks, making even the air seem reluctant to move. Overhead, a colourless sky hangs low, flattening the world beneath it until the buildings look less like structures and more like tired outlines.

At first glance, everything appears simple: space, distance, stillness. But the longer you stare, the more the details begin to insist on being noticed. Edges are worn smooth, surfaces dulled, the ground marked by the faint memory of use. It is a place that has not been destroyed—only neglected, which somehow feels worse. Neglect means it was left on purpose.

There is a moment where calm tilts into something sharper. In the absence of people, the scene becomes too quiet, too controlled, like a photograph that refuses to tell you what happened before it was taken. You begin to search for a clue: a sign, a shadow, a single hint of life.

Nothing arrives. The silence stays.

# TASK 2 — Narrative: "The door was already open." (45 mins)

## Mark scheme guide

**Top marks come from structure, not complicated plot.**  
A Grade 9 story is usually simple events, expertly told.

## Top-band checklist (tickable)

- [ ] The opening line creates a question / mystery
- [ ] I show emotion through action (not "I was scared")
- [ ] I include a turning point (decision / discovery / consequence)
- [ ] I control pace (slow build → quick moment → slow aftershock)
- [ ] Ending is controlled (echoes opening / reveals meaning)
- [ ] Sentence variety includes 1–2 fragments for impact
- [ ] Punctuation used for effect (colon / dash / semicolon) correctly

## Step-by-step method

**0–5 min:** choose 1 structure

- Door → discovery → consequence
- Door → memory → twist
- Door → rescue → reveal

**5–10 min:** plan 5 beats

1. Approach
2. Threshold moment (crossing)
3. Discovery
4. Turning point choice
5. Aftermath (changed character)

**10–40 min:** write in 5 short scenes

**40–45 min:** upgrade pass

- Replace 5 "said / went / got"
- Add 2 sensory details
- Add 1 line that echoes the opening

## Model answers

### Grade 4

The door was already open. I stopped and looked at it because I was sure I shut it this morning. I pushed it a little and it moved easily.

Inside, my house was quiet. I called out, "Mum?" but nobody answered. I walked into the living room and everything looked normal, but I still felt worried.

I checked upstairs and my room was fine. Then I heard a small noise from the kitchen. My heart went fast and I walked slowly.

It was just the cat knocking over a cup. I laughed a bit because I had been scared for nothing, then I closed the door properly.

---

### Grade 6

The door was already open, just slightly, as if someone had changed their mind halfway through leaving. I stood on the step, keys cold in my palm, trying to remember whether I had locked it.

I pushed the door and it swung wider without resistance. The hallway felt wrong—too still, too quiet. I called out, but my voice sounded small and flat, like it didn't belong in my own house.

In the kitchen, a chair was pulled away from the table. Not much, but enough to make my stomach tighten. I moved closer and noticed something else: the back door was open too.

Then a shape shifted behind the curtain. I froze.

A second later, my brother stepped out, grinning. "Relax," he said, "Mum sent me back for my bag." I breathed out, annoyed at myself, and shut the door—this time, carefully.

---

### Grade 8

The door was already open. Not wide—just enough to suggest a choice had been made. I stopped, keys hovering near the lock, and listened. Nothing. No TV. No footsteps. Just the faint hum of the fridge somewhere inside.

I pushed the door. It sighed inward.

The house looked ordinary, but the ordinary details felt staged: a mug left on the side, a jacket slung over the banister, a strip of sunlight across the carpet like a warning line. I called out. My words disappeared into the quiet.

Then I noticed the photograph on the hallway table. It had been moved. Turned slightly, facing the door.

Behind me, the open door shifted with the wind and tapped softly against the frame—tap, tap, tap—like someone impatient.

I stepped forward anyway, because sometimes fear isn't loud. Sometimes it's polite. And it lets you walk straight into it.

---

### Grade 9

The door was already open—only a fraction, as if the house itself were undecided about letting me in. I stood for a moment on the threshold, the key biting into my fingers, and tried to convince myself there was a simple explanation. There always is, until there isn't.

When I pushed, the door moved too easily. The hallway breathed out a cold, familiar air. Familiar, yet wrong. Silence sat in the corners like dust, undisturbed.

I noticed the small things first. The shoe mat angled slightly, as if someone had stepped in hurriedly. A single drip mark down the wall from a wet umbrella that wasn't there. A mug on the table with a tea-bag string hanging over the rim—unfinished, abandoned. My mind collected these details like evidence, building a story it didn't want to tell.

Upstairs, a floorboard creaked.

I didn't move. My body went still, not brave, just… careful. In that moment I realised what the open door really meant: someone had been here without permission, and the house—my house—had let them.

I took one step forward anyway. Because doors don't just open. People do.

# TASK 3 — Describe a place as it changes over time (45 mins)

**Description • 45 minutes**

## Mark scheme – what examiners reward

### AO5 (Content & Structure – 24 marks)

Top-band responses:

- Track change clearly and deliberately
- Use structure to show time passing (paragraph shifts, contrast)
- Choose details that symbolise change, not random description
- End with a reflective or insightful final image

Lower bands describe change; top bands make the place **represent something larger** (loss, decay, growth, memory).

### AO6 (Technical Accuracy – 16 marks)

Top-band responses:

- Use varied sentence structures
- Control tense consistently
- Use punctuation for effect (not decoration)
- Spell ambitious vocabulary accurately

## Top-band checklist (Grade 8–9)

**Focus & meaning**

- [ ] I make it clear what the place is and why it matters
- [ ] The change over time is central, not just mentioned

**Structure**

- [ ] I clearly separate time stages (before → during → now)
- [ ] Each paragraph has a purpose (not just length)
- [ ] I include a deliberate structural shift

**Language**

- [ ] I track one motif changing (sound, colour, smell, objects)
- [ ] I use imagery that reflects time passing
- [ ] Verbs show change (eroded, faded, softened, sharpened)

**Ending**

- [ ] The final paragraph reflects on the change
- [ ] The ending feels controlled, not rushed

**AO6**

- [ ] Sentence lengths vary intentionally
- [ ] I use commas, dashes, or colons correctly
- [ ] I proofread for accuracy

## Step-by-step method

**0–5 min: Plan**

- Choose one setting (street, park, bedroom, shop, classroom)
- Choose three time points: **Past** (how it was), **Middle** (change beginning), **Present** (how it is now)
- Choose one motif (e.g. colour, noise, light, objects)

**5–35 min: Write (4 paragraphs)**

1. Past – vivid, alive
2. Early change – subtle shift
3. Present – contrast / loss / transformation
4. Reflection – what the change means

**35–45 min: Upgrade**

- Replace weak verbs
- Add 1 structural phrase ("Years later…", "Now…")
- Sharpen the final sentence

## Model answers

### Grade 4 (clear, simple, organised)

The park used to be full of life. Children ran across the grass and people sat on benches talking. The trees were green and the paths were clean. It felt like a happy place where everyone wanted to be.

As time passed, things slowly changed. Fewer people visited the park and some of the paint on the benches started to peel. The grass grew uneven and litter sometimes appeared near the bins. It wasn't as lively as before.

Now the park feels quiet and empty. The swings creak in the wind and the paths are cracked. The trees are still there, but they don't look as bright. It feels like people have forgotten about it.

The park has changed from a busy place to a lonely one.

---

### Grade 6 (developed detail + clearer contrast)

Years ago, the park was always busy. Laughter echoed across the grass and the air smelled fresh, especially in the summer. Benches were painted bright green and the paths were smooth from constant use. It felt welcoming, like a place meant to be shared.

Slowly, the energy faded. Fewer voices filled the space and the paint on the benches began to flake away. Weeds pushed through cracks in the paths and rubbish sometimes gathered near the gate. The park still existed, but it no longer felt important.

Now, the park is mostly silent. The swings sway without anyone pushing them, and the grass is dull and patchy. The benches are cold and chipped, and the only sounds come from the wind moving through the trees.

Time has changed the park quietly, leaving behind a place that remembers being used.

---

### Grade 8 (controlled structure + symbolic change)

The park was once loud with life. Children shouted across the grass, dogs pulled at their leads, and benches were never empty for long. Bright paint reflected sunlight, and the paths were worn smooth by constant movement. It was a place that felt alive because people filled it.

Over time, the noise thinned out. The laughter became occasional instead of constant. Paint began to peel from the benches, and the grass grew longer, untamed. Small signs of neglect crept in quietly, almost unnoticed at first.

Now, silence dominates the space. The swings move only when the wind touches them, and the paths are cracked and uneven. The trees still stand, but their shade feels heavier, more tired. The park exists, but it no longer invites.

Time didn't destroy the park—it simply stopped paying attention to it.

---

### Grade 9 (sophisticated control + reflective insight)

Once, the park belonged to people. It echoed with footsteps and laughter, the grass flattened beneath constant movement. Benches gleamed with fresh paint, warm in the sun, and the air carried the mixed smells of cut grass and food wrappers. Everything felt temporary in the best way—always changing, always used.

Then the change began quietly. Voices arrived less often. The paint dulled, chipped by weather and time, and weeds began to claim the edges of the paths. The park wasn't abandoned, just slowly overlooked. Neglect settled in gently, without announcement.

Now, the park feels suspended. Swings creak without purpose, benches sit cold and splintered, and the paths fracture underfoot. Even the trees seem heavier, their shadows darker, stretching across empty ground. The place still stands, but its role has shifted—from centre of activity to reminder of absence.

Time didn't rush this change. It waited, patient, until no one was watching.

## Model answers

### Grade 4

I was walking home from school when the problem happened. I reached into my pocket and realised my phone wasn't there. At first I thought I had dropped it, so I turned around quickly.

I walked back along the road, looking at the ground. People passed me and I felt nervous. My phone had everything on it and I didn't know what to do.

After a few minutes, I saw it near the bus stop. Someone had placed it on the bench. I felt relieved and picked it up straight away.

I walked home carefully after that, checking my pockets again and again.

---

### Grade 6

Everything was normal until I reached the corner near my house. I reached into my pocket to check the time, and my phone was gone. My stomach tightened instantly.

I retraced my steps, scanning the pavement as I walked. Cars passed and people moved around me, but I felt alone. My phone wasn't just a phone—it held messages, photos, reminders of everything important.

Just as panic began to settle, I spotted it resting on a bench near the bus stop. Someone must have found it and left it there. Relief rushed through me, leaving me embarrassed at how quickly I had panicked.

I put the phone safely away and continued home, more aware than before.

---

### Grade 8

The problem arrived without warning. One moment I was scrolling through messages as I walked; the next, my pocket was empty. I stopped abruptly, heart racing, and checked again—slowly this time. Nothing.

The street suddenly felt louder. Every passing car sounded impatient, every stranger suspicious. I turned back, eyes fixed on the pavement, replaying the last ten minutes in my head. Had it fallen? Had someone picked it up?

Near the bus stop, I saw it. My phone lay face down on the bench, exactly where I must have left it. Relief hit first, followed closely by frustration at myself.

As I picked it up, I realised how easily things can slip away when you stop paying attention—even for a moment.

---

### Grade 9

The problem didn't announce itself. It crept in quietly, unnoticed, until it was impossible to ignore. I reached into my pocket out of habit—and found nothing.

I stopped walking. Around me, the street continued as if nothing had changed. Cars moved, people talked, life carried on. But inside my head, everything stalled. My phone was gone. With it went messages I hadn't replied to, photos I hadn't backed up, pieces of my routine I relied on without thinking.

I turned back, scanning the ground, my mind replaying the journey like faulty footage. Each step felt heavier than the last. Panic hovered just beneath the surface, waiting.

Then I saw it—resting on a bench, face down, unharmed. Relief flooded through me so suddenly it almost hurt. I picked it up carefully, as if it might disappear again.

Walking home, I didn't check my screen. I didn't need to. The problem had passed, but it had left something behind: the uncomfortable realisation of how fragile normal can be.

## Model answers

### Grade 4

Everything felt silent when I woke up early one morning. The house was quiet and no one else was awake. I could not hear the TV or people talking.

The rooms felt bigger than usual. I walked downstairs slowly and the floorboards creaked under my feet. Even small sounds seemed loud because everything else was so quiet.

Outside, the street was empty. There were no cars and no people walking past. The air felt cold and still.

It was a strange silence that made me feel calm but also a little uncomfortable.

---

### Grade 6

The silence arrived suddenly, filling the room as soon as I opened my eyes. There was no sound of voices or movement, just a quiet that felt heavier than usual.

The house seemed different in the silence. Every small noise stood out—the creak of the stairs, the soft hum of the fridge. Even my breathing sounded too loud, as if it didn't belong.

Outside, the street was empty. No cars passed and no doors opened. The world felt paused, like everything was waiting for something to happen.

The silence didn't last long, but while it did, it made everything feel unfamiliar.

---

### Grade 8

Silence settled in the room before I did. It pressed against the walls, thick and unfamiliar, making the space feel larger and emptier than it should have been. Nothing moved. Nothing spoke.

I noticed details I would usually ignore: the faint glow of light through the curtains, the slow rise and fall of my own breathing. Each sound I made felt intrusive, like I was disturbing something fragile.

Outside, the world matched the stillness. The street lay empty, stripped of its usual noise. No engines, no footsteps—only the quiet stretching on.

In that moment, the silence felt powerful. It demanded attention, forcing me to sit with my thoughts instead of escaping them.

---

### Grade 9

Silence didn't arrive suddenly—it was already there, waiting. It filled the space so completely that it felt deliberate, as though the world had agreed to stop at the same moment. No voices. No movement. Just stillness.

The room felt altered by it. Light slipped quietly through the curtains, settling on furniture that suddenly seemed unfamiliar. Even my breathing felt out of place, too sharp against the quiet. I became aware of myself in a way that noise usually prevents.

Outside, the silence continued. The street lay empty, stripped of its usual rhythm. Without sound, time felt stretched, fragile, as if it could break if disturbed.

When noise eventually returned, it felt intrusive. The silence had said something important, and breaking it felt like an interruption.

## Model answers

### Grade 4

I believe school uniforms are a good idea. They make everyone look the same and stop people being judged on clothes.

Uniforms also make it easier to get ready for school in the morning. Students do not have to worry about what to wear.

Some people say uniforms stop students expressing themselves, but I think school is for learning, not fashion.

In conclusion, school uniforms help students focus and feel equal.

---

### Grade 6

I believe school uniforms should be worn by all students. Uniforms help create equality and prevent students from being judged by what they wear.

When everyone wears the same clothes, there is less pressure to keep up with fashion trends. This allows students to focus on learning instead of appearance.

Some people argue that uniforms limit individuality. However, students can still express themselves through their personality, behaviour and achievements.

Overall, school uniforms support a positive learning environment and should remain part of school life.

---

### Grade 8

Good morning everyone. Today, I want to explain why school uniforms are beneficial for students and schools alike. Uniforms are not about control—they are about fairness.

By wearing the same clothes, students are less likely to feel judged or excluded. Uniforms reduce pressure to follow expensive trends, allowing students to focus on what really matters: education.

While some argue that uniforms restrict individuality, this ignores the fact that self-expression comes from actions, ideas and achievements—not clothing. Schools are places of learning, not fashion shows.

For these reasons, school uniforms create a more focused, inclusive environment and should be valued.

---

### Grade 9

Good morning. Today, I want to challenge the idea that school uniforms limit students—and instead suggest that they support them.

Uniforms remove a silent but powerful pressure. When clothing is no longer a competition, students are free to focus on learning rather than appearance. No one is judged for wearing the wrong brand or the same outfit twice. Equality becomes visible.

Critics argue that uniforms restrict individuality. However, true individuality is shown through ideas, effort and character—not fabric. A uniform does not silence a student's voice; it simply removes distractions.

If we want schools to be places of focus, fairness and opportunity, then uniforms are not the problem. They are part of the solution.

## Model answers

### Grade 4

Protecting the environment is important for everyone. The environment gives us clean air, water and food, so we need to look after it.

Pollution and litter damage nature and harm animals. When rubbish is left on the ground, it can end up in rivers and oceans. This causes problems for wildlife and makes places look unpleasant.

If we do not protect the environment, future generations will suffer. There will be fewer animals and more pollution.

Everyone should try to recycle, save energy and keep their area clean so the environment can be protected.

---

### Grade 6

Protecting the environment is one of the most important issues facing the world today. Our planet provides everything we need to survive, yet human activity continues to damage it.

Pollution, deforestation and climate change all have serious consequences. Animals lose their habitats, air quality worsens and extreme weather becomes more common. These problems do not just affect nature — they affect people too.

If action is not taken now, future generations will face a world with fewer resources and more danger. Small actions, such as recycling and reducing energy use, can make a difference.

Protecting the environment is not just a choice; it is a responsibility we all share.

---

### Grade 8

Protecting the environment has become urgent rather than optional. The natural world supports human life, yet it is increasingly damaged by pollution, waste and climate change.

The consequences of environmental neglect are already visible. Wildlife habitats are destroyed, oceans fill with plastic, and extreme weather events are becoming more frequent. These issues do not remain distant — they affect food supplies, health and living conditions.

Action matters because damage to the environment is often irreversible. Once ecosystems collapse, they cannot simply be rebuilt. Individual choices, combined with government action, can slow this damage and protect what remains.

If the environment is not protected now, the cost will be paid later. The responsibility lies with everyone.

### Grade 9

Protecting the environment is no longer a distant concern; it is a pressing responsibility. The natural world supports every aspect of human life, yet it continues to be treated as expendable.

Environmental damage has consequences that extend far beyond nature itself. Rising sea levels threaten communities, pollution damages health, and the destruction of habitats pushes species towards extinction. These are not future problems — they are happening now.

What makes this issue so serious is its permanence. Once ecosystems are destroyed, recovery is slow or impossible. Every delay increases the damage, leaving fewer options for the future.

Protecting the environment requires both individual responsibility and collective action. If change does not happen now, the cost will not be paid by those causing the damage, but by those who inherit its effects.

### Grade 4

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to complain about the litter problem in my area. There is rubbish on the streets and it is not being cleaned properly.

The litter makes the area look untidy and can be dangerous. It also attracts animals and smells bad.

I think more bins should be added and the streets should be cleaned more often.

Yours faithfully,
A Resident

### Grade 6

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to express my concern about the increasing amount of litter in my local area. Over recent months, rubbish has been left on pavements and in public spaces.

This issue affects residents by making the area look neglected and creating health risks. It also discourages people from using shared spaces.

I suggest installing additional bins and arranging more regular cleaning. This would improve the area for everyone.

Yours faithfully,
A Concerned Resident

### Grade 8

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to raise concerns regarding the ongoing problem of litter in my neighbourhood. Despite previous clean-up efforts, the issue continues to worsen.

Litter not only damages the appearance of the area but also poses health risks and harms wildlife. Many residents feel frustrated by the lack of lasting improvement.

I would recommend increasing the number of waste bins and improving waste collection schedules. These measures would help address the problem more effectively.

I look forward to your response.

Yours faithfully,
A Local Resident

### Grade 9

Dear Sir or Madam,

I am writing to formally raise concerns about the persistent litter problem in my local area. Despite previous reports, the issue remains unresolved and continues to affect residents.

Public spaces are frequently left covered in rubbish, which damages the appearance of the neighbourhood and presents health and environmental risks. This has led to growing frustration among residents who take pride in their community.

To address this issue, I suggest increasing the number of waste bins and implementing more regular street cleaning. Clear signage encouraging responsible behaviour may also be effective.

I trust that the council will consider these concerns seriously and take appropriate action.

Yours faithfully,
A Local Resident

### Grade 8

**Staying Safe Online: A Guide for Teenagers**

Using the internet is part of everyday life, but it also brings risks. Understanding these risks helps teenagers stay in control online.

**Think Before You Share**

**Online Strangers**
Some people online may not be who they claim to be. Avoid sharing personal information and never agree to meet someone without adult permission.

### Grade 9

**Online Safety: Protecting Yourself in a Digital World**

The internet offers opportunities for learning and connection, but it also exposes teenagers to serious risks. Understanding how to stay safe online is essential.

**Protect Your Personal Information**
Personal details such as your address, school and passwords should never be shared online. Once information is shared, it can be difficult to control where it ends up.

**Be Cautious with Online Contacts**
Not everyone online is trustworthy. Some individuals create false identities to gain trust. Avoid private conversations with strangers and never agree to meet without adult involvement.

**Recognising and Responding to Online Harm**
Cyberbullying and scams are increasingly common. If you receive threatening or suspicious messages, do not respond. Block the user, report the behaviour and seek support from a trusted adult.

Staying safe online does not mean avoiding the internet — it means using it wisely, confidently and responsibly.
