## TASK 1 — P-S01 (Ozymandias)

**How does the poet present power in Ozymandias?**

### Grade 4
Power in Ozymandias is presented as something that does not last. The ruler Ozymandias believes he is very powerful, calling himself the "king of kings", which shows he thinks he is greater than all others. This makes him seem proud and arrogant.

However, the statue is described as broken and ruined. This shows that even though Ozymandias once had power, it has been destroyed over time. The desert around the statue is empty, suggesting that nothing remains of his empire.

The poet shows that power can fade and that time is stronger than people.

### Grade 6
In Ozymandias, Shelley presents power as temporary and unreliable. Ozymandias presents himself as extremely powerful, calling himself the "king of kings". This title suggests absolute authority and pride, showing that he believes his power will last forever.

However, this belief is contradicted by the ruined statue. The description of the "colossal wreck" shows that his power has collapsed. The empty desert surrounding the statue emphasises how time has erased his achievements.

Shelley suggests that power based on pride and control does not last and will eventually be destroyed.

### Grade 8
Shelley presents power in Ozymandias as an illusion that is destroyed by time. Ozymandias' command to "look on my works" suggests confidence and arrogance, as he believes his power is unquestionable. The grand language reflects how rulers attempt to present themselves as permanent and superior.

However, this idea is undermined by the ruined statue. The image of a "colossal wreck" creates a sharp contrast between Ozymandias' belief in his power and the reality of his downfall. The vast, empty desert surrounding the statue reinforces the idea that time and nature outlast human authority.

As a Romantic poet, Shelley criticises tyrannical power and suggests that rulers who seek control and legacy will ultimately be forgotten.

### Grade 9
In Ozymandias, Shelley presents power as arrogant, self-deceiving and ultimately insignificant when measured against time. Ozymandias' declaration, "king of kings", reflects absolute confidence in his authority and suggests a desire to dominate both people and history. This language exposes power as performative — something proclaimed rather than earned.

However, Shelley systematically dismantles this illusion. The statue's "shattered visage" and the description of a "colossal wreck" undermine the ruler's claims, revealing the emptiness behind his authority. Structurally, the framed narrative distances the reader from Ozymandias, reinforcing how his power has faded into obscurity.

Contextually, Shelley's Romantic beliefs emphasised the supremacy of nature over human ambition. Power is therefore presented not as enduring, but as something that collapses under its own arrogance. An alternative interpretation is that Ozymandias' power survives only as a warning, suggesting that failed authority still leaves a moral legacy.

## TASK 2 — P-S03 (Kamikaze)

**How does the poet present memory in Kamikaze?**

### Grade 4
In Kamikaze, memory is shown as something that affects how people are treated. The pilot is remembered for turning back from his mission, and this changes how his family behaves towards him.

Although he returns alive, the family acts as if he is dead. This shows that memory can be painful and can lead to sadness.

The poet presents memory as something that causes suffering.

### Grade 6
Garland presents memory as powerful and controlling in Kamikaze. The pilot's decision to turn back becomes the most important memory associated with him. This memory causes his family to reject him, treating him as if he no longer exists.

Positive memories of nature, such as the sea and fish, contrast with the negative memories created by his return. These memories show the conflict between personal experience and social judgement.

Garland suggests that memory can shape identity and lead to punishment.

### Grade 8
In Kamikaze, Garland presents memory as both life-affirming and destructive. The pilot's memories of the natural world interrupt his mission, reconnecting him with beauty and life. These memories are vivid and sensory, suggesting their emotional importance.

However, the memory of his return becomes a source of shame. His family remember his survival as dishonour, and this collective memory leads to silence and rejection. Structurally, the shift from natural imagery to emotional distance reflects how memory changes meaning over time.

Garland suggests that memory can preserve humanity but also enforce cruel social expectations.

### Grade 9
Garland presents memory in Kamikaze as a force that both saves and condemns. The pilot's memories of the sea and childhood interrupt his mission, suggesting that memory reconnects him with personal identity and moral instinct. The natural imagery contrasts sharply with the rigid ideology of honour.

However, memory also becomes a form of punishment. The family's silence shows that the pilot is remembered not as a survivor but as a failure. Structurally, the fragmented narrative reflects how memory is filtered and reshaped by perspective.

Contextually, cultural expectations surrounding honour intensify this rejection. An alternative interpretation is that memory preserves moral truth, even if society chooses to punish those who act upon it.

## TASK 3 — P-C02 (Exposure & Bayonet Charge)

**Compare how conflict is presented in Exposure and Bayonet Charge.**

### Grade 4
Both Exposure and Bayonet Charge present conflict as frightening and unpleasant. In Exposure, the soldiers face conflict through the cold weather. The wind and snow make their situation dangerous, showing that nature is an enemy.

In Bayonet Charge, conflict is shown through action. The soldier runs forward while bullets fly around him, creating fear and panic. This shows how dangerous war is.

Both poems show that conflict causes suffering and fear for soldiers.

### Grade 6
Both poems present conflict as overwhelming, but in different ways. In Exposure, conflict is mainly against nature. The soldiers suffer from cold and exhaustion, suggesting that the environment is more powerful than the enemy.

In contrast, Bayonet Charge presents conflict as immediate and violent. The soldier is suddenly thrown into action, and the fast pace reflects panic and confusion. Unlike Exposure, there is no waiting.

Both poets show conflict as frightening and destructive, challenging romantic ideas about war.

### Grade 8
Both Exposure and Bayonet Charge present conflict as destructive, but they focus on different experiences of war. In Exposure, conflict is prolonged and impersonal. The soldiers battle the cold rather than an enemy, and the repeated suffering suggests hopelessness and endurance.

In Bayonet Charge, conflict is sudden and chaotic. The rapid movement and violent imagery reflect the soldier's panic and instinctive fear. While Exposure focuses on waiting and mental exhaustion, Bayonet Charge captures the shock of immediate combat.

Together, the poems present conflict as dehumanising and traumatic, stripping war of any sense of glory.

### Grade 9
Both poems present conflict as destructive, but they explore different dimensions of wartime suffering. In Exposure, Owen presents conflict as prolonged and impersonal, with soldiers battling the cold rather than a visible enemy. Nature becomes the dominant force, slowly draining hope and morale, which suggests the futility of trench warfare.

In contrast, Bayonet Charge presents conflict as immediate and instinctive. The soldier's sudden movement through the battlefield reflects panic rather than purpose, exposing the gap between patriotic ideals and lived experience. The rapid pace mirrors the collapse of rational thought under pressure.

Contextually, Owen exposes the reality of trench warfare, while Hughes highlights the primal fear beneath heroic narratives. Both poets ultimately present conflict as stripping soldiers of control, but while Exposure emphasises endurance, Bayonet Charge exposes sudden terror.

## TASK 4 — P-C03 (Checking Out Me History & Kamikaze)

**Compare how identity is explored in Checking Out Me History and Kamikaze.**

### Grade 4
Both poems explore identity and how it is affected by society. In Checking Out Me History, the speaker wants to learn about his past and who he really is.

In Kamikaze, the pilot's identity changes after he returns from his mission. His family treat him differently, which affects how he is seen.

Both poems show that identity can be controlled by others.

### Grade 6
Both poems explore identity as something shaped by outside forces. In Checking Out Me History, the speaker feels his identity has been hidden by the education system, which teaches him only part of history.

In Kamikaze, the pilot's identity is judged by his community. Although he survives, he is remembered as a failure. Both poems show that identity is affected by social expectations.

The poets suggest that identity is not always chosen freely.

### Grade 8
Both poems explore identity as something shaped by power and culture. In Checking Out Me History, Agard shows identity being controlled through education. The speaker challenges this by reclaiming his history and voice, which strengthens his sense of self.

In contrast, Kamikaze presents identity as something imposed by society. The pilot's identity shifts from hero to outcast because of cultural expectations around honour. Structurally, Agard's confident voice contrasts with Garland's distant narration, reflecting resistance versus silence.

Both poets show identity as deeply connected to social control.

### Grade 9
Both poems explore identity as something imposed and contested within systems of power. In Checking Out Me History, Agard exposes how institutional education erases cultural identity, limiting self-understanding. By reclaiming historical figures, the speaker actively reconstructs his identity and challenges authority.

In Kamikaze, identity is shaped by collective judgement rather than personal truth. The pilot's survival redefines him as dishonourable, and silence becomes a tool of control. Structurally, Garland's detached narration reflects how identity is stripped away through social rejection.

Contextually, both poets critique systems that define individuals by ideology. However, while Agard presents identity as reclaimable through resistance, Garland presents identity as fragile, shaped by memory and communal values rather than individual choice.

## TASK 5 — UP-02 (Unseen Poetry)

**How does the poet use language and structure to create a sense of tension?**

### Grade 4
The poet creates tension by using language that makes the situation feel uncertain. Some words suggest quietness and waiting, which makes the reader feel that something might happen.

The structure also helps to create tension. Short lines make the poem feel sharp and uncomfortable, while longer sentences slow the pace. This makes the reader feel uneasy.

Overall, tension is created through the poet's language and the way the poem is organised.

### Grade 6
The poet creates tension by choosing language that suggests uncertainty and unease. Descriptions of stillness and silence create the feeling that something is about to happen, which keeps the reader alert.

Structurally, enjambment is used to carry ideas across lines, delaying meaning and increasing suspense. The pace of the poem changes, which reflects growing tension.

Together, the poet's language and structure make the poem feel uncomfortable and tense.

### Grade 8
The poet uses both language and structure to gradually build tension. Language linked to restraint and hesitation creates anticipation, suggesting that action is being delayed. This makes the reader aware of what is not happening as much as what is.

Structurally, enjambment disrupts natural pauses, forcing the reader forward without resolution. The poem's pacing shifts as tension increases, creating a sense of instability.

By controlling when information is revealed, the poet sustains tension and keeps the reader uncertain throughout.

### Grade 9
The poet creates tension by carefully manipulating what is revealed and what is withheld. Language associated with stillness and control suggests suppressed action, creating unease through anticipation rather than explicit threat. This restraint forces the reader to imagine what might happen next.

Structurally, enjambment delays meaning and disrupts closure, preventing the reader from settling into a comfortable rhythm. Changes in pace reflect rising emotional pressure, while moments of pause intensify suspense.

An alternative interpretation is that the tension is internal rather than external, reflecting psychological conflict rather than immediate danger. In both readings, tension is sustained through uncertainty and controlled revelation.

## TASK 6 — UP-C02 (Unseen Poetry Comparison)

**Compare how imagery is used in both poems.**

### Grade 4
Both poems use imagery to help the reader imagine what is happening. In the first poem, imagery creates a clear picture of the setting.

In the second poem, imagery is also important and helps show how the speaker feels. Both poets use imagery to help communicate their ideas.

### Grade 6
Both poems use imagery to express ideas, but in different ways. In the first poem, imagery is used to describe the environment, helping the reader visualise the scene.

In the second poem, imagery focuses more on feelings and emotions. Comparing the two shows that imagery can be used for different purposes.

### Grade 8
Both poets use imagery to shape meaning, but their focus differs. In the first poem, imagery establishes atmosphere and setting, grounding the poem in a physical place. This helps the reader understand the situation.

In contrast, the second poem uses imagery to reflect inner emotions rather than surroundings. The images suggest feelings rather than places, making the poem more psychological in tone.

Comparing the poems shows how imagery can either externalise experience or reveal internal states.

### Grade 9
Both poets rely on imagery as a central method for shaping meaning, yet they deploy it for different effects. In the first poem, imagery constructs the external world, influencing how the reader interprets events and tension through physical description.

In the second poem, imagery functions symbolically, reflecting emotional or psychological states rather than literal setting. This contrast highlights how imagery can either anchor meaning in lived experience or elevate it into abstract reflection.

The comparison shows that while imagery is fundamental in both poems, its purpose shifts depending on whether the poet prioritises environment or inner conflict.

## TASK 7 — M-03 (Macbeth)

**How does Shakespeare present guilt in the play as a whole?**

### Grade 4
Shakespeare presents guilt as something that affects characters' minds. After killing Duncan, Macbeth feels guilty and cannot sleep. This shows that his actions trouble him.

Lady Macbeth also feels guilty later in the play. She starts off strong but later becomes weak and upset. This shows guilt can change people.

Shakespeare shows that guilt is a punishment for bad actions.

### Grade 6
Shakespeare presents guilt as a powerful force that causes suffering. Macbeth feels guilt immediately after killing Duncan, shown by his fear and inability to sleep. His guilt makes him paranoid and uneasy.

Lady Macbeth tries to ignore guilt at first, but it eventually overwhelms her. She becomes disturbed and unable to cope. This shows guilt cannot be avoided.

Shakespeare suggests guilt is a natural response to wrongdoing.

### Grade 8
Shakespeare presents guilt as corrosive and inescapable. Macbeth's guilt appears immediately after Duncan's murder, disrupting his peace and sense of control. Imagery of blood suggests guilt cannot be washed away.

In contrast, Lady Macbeth initially suppresses guilt, believing it can be ignored. However, her mental collapse later in the play shows that guilt resurfaces with greater force. Structurally, guilt intensifies as the play progresses, reflecting moral decay.

Shakespeare links guilt to disorder, suggesting it is a consequence of disrupting the natural order.

### Grade 9
Shakespeare presents guilt as an internal punishment that enforces moral order. Macbeth's immediate disturbance after Duncan's murder reveals a functioning conscience, with guilt manifesting through fear, paranoia and hallucination. Blood imagery symbolises guilt as permanent and inescapable.

Lady Macbeth's guilt develops differently. She initially represses conscience, equating guilt with weakness, but this suppression leads to psychological collapse. Structurally, Shakespeare contrasts Macbeth's early guilt with later emotional numbness, suggesting guilt mutates into moral desensitisation rather than disappearing.

Contextually, guilt aligns with Jacobean beliefs about sin and divine justice. Alternatively, Shakespeare may suggest guilt is not enough to prevent tyranny, as Macbeth continues despite recognising his crimes.

## TASK 8 — ACC-01 (A Christmas Carol)

**How does Dickens present Scrooge as selfish in this extract?**

### Grade 4
Dickens presents Scrooge as selfish by showing that he only cares about money. He is described as cold and uncaring, which reflects his attitude towards others.

He does not want to help people in need. This makes him seem unkind.

Dickens wants readers to dislike Scrooge at this point.

### Grade 6
In the extract, Dickens presents Scrooge as selfish through negative description. Scrooge is shown as cold and isolated, suggesting he values money over people.

The narrator's tone encourages the reader to judge Scrooge. His selfishness is shown through his lack of empathy.

Dickens presents Scrooge as a moral failure.

### Grade 8
Dickens presents Scrooge's selfishness as both emotional and social. Cold imagery reflects his lack of compassion and isolation from others. The narrator exaggerates these qualities to emphasise moral emptiness.

Scrooge's selfishness contrasts with the needs of those around him, exposing social injustice. Dickens uses this extract to criticise attitudes that prioritise wealth over humanity.

### Grade 9
Dickens presents Scrooge's selfishness as corrosive and socially damaging. Cold imagery reflects emotional barrenness, while the narrator's critical tone invites moral judgement. Scrooge's isolation suggests selfishness leads to disconnection from society.

Contextually, Dickens condemns selfishness amid Victorian poverty. Alternatively, the exaggeration of Scrooge's flaws prepares the reader for transformation, framing selfishness as a curable moral failing rather than permanent evil.

---

## TASK 9 — ACC-02 (A Christmas Carol)

**How does Dickens present the theme of redemption?**

### Grade 4
Dickens presents redemption by showing Scrooge change. He starts off selfish but becomes kind.

This shows people can improve.

### Grade 6
Redemption is shown through Scrooge's journey. The Spirits help him see his mistakes, and he learns to care about others.

Dickens shows redemption is possible.

### Grade 8
Dickens presents redemption as a moral journey. The Spirits guide Scrooge through reflection on past, present and future, forcing him to confront consequences.

Redemption is shown as earned through understanding and change.

### Grade 9
Dickens presents redemption as active moral responsibility. Scrooge's transformation occurs through confrontation with suffering and consequence. The structured visits mirror spiritual rebirth, reinforcing Christian ideas of repentance.

Contextually, Dickens suggests social reform begins with individual change. Alternatively, the reliance on supernatural intervention implies redemption requires guidance rather than self-realisation alone.

## TASK 10 — ACC-03 (A Christmas Carol)

**How does Dickens use the Cratchits to convey his message?**

### Grade 4
The Cratchits show kindness despite being poor. They care for each other.

Dickens uses them to show family is important.

### Grade 6
Dickens uses the Cratchits to show happiness does not depend on money. They contrast with Scrooge.

This shows Dickens' message about generosity.

### Grade 8
The Cratchits represent moral wealth. Their warmth contrasts with Scrooge's isolation, highlighting emotional richness over material success.

Dickens uses them to criticise social inequality.

### Grade 9
Dickens uses the Cratchits as a moral counterpoint to capitalist selfishness. Their generosity under hardship exposes the failure of a society that neglects its vulnerable. Contextually, Dickens urges social responsibility. Alternatively, their idealisation strengthens the emotional impact of his message.

## TASK 11 — JH-01 (Jekyll and Hyde)

**How does Stevenson present Hyde as frightening?**

### Grade 4
Hyde is frightening because he is violent and strange. People are scared of him.

This shows he is dangerous.

### Grade 6
Hyde is frightening because of his behaviour and unclear appearance. People feel uneasy around him.

Stevenson makes Hyde seem evil.

### Grade 8
Stevenson presents Hyde as frightening through ambiguity and violence. His unclear appearance suggests moral corruption rather than physical deformity.

This makes him unsettling.

### Grade 9
Hyde is frightening because he embodies moral degeneration. Stevenson's refusal to clearly describe him creates fear through uncertainty. Contextually, Hyde reflects Victorian fears of repression and hidden desire. Alternatively, Hyde is frightening because he represents impulses society refuses to acknowledge.

---

## TASK 12 — JH-02 (Jekyll and Hyde)

**How does Stevenson explore duality through Jekyll?**

### Grade 4
Jekyll has two sides: good and bad.

This shows people can be different.

### Grade 6
Stevenson shows duality by separating Jekyll and Hyde. Jekyll wants to hide his bad side.

This causes problems.

### Grade 8
Jekyll's attempt to separate good and evil shows duality. Hyde becomes stronger, suggesting imbalance.

This shows danger of repression.

### Grade 9
Stevenson explores duality as internal conflict. Jekyll's attempt to isolate morality leads to loss of control. Structurally, delayed revelation mirrors repression. Contextually, the novel reflects anxieties about respectability. Alternatively, Stevenson suggests duality cannot be divided without destruction.

---

## TASK 13 — AIC-01 (An Inspector Calls)

**How does Priestley present responsibility in the play?**

### Grade 4
Priestley shows responsibility by making characters admit their actions.

### Grade 6
Responsibility is shown through the Inspector questioning characters. Younger characters accept it more.

### Grade 8
Responsibility is shown as moral duty. Priestley contrasts attitudes to show consequences.

### Grade 9
Priestley presents responsibility as collective duty. Dramatic structure exposes consequence. Contextually, this supports socialist ideology. Alternatively, cyclical structure suggests society resists responsibility.

---

## TASK 14 — AIC-02 (An Inspector Calls)

**How does Priestley use the Inspector to convey his ideas?**

### Grade 4
The Inspector teaches characters a lesson.

### Grade 6
The Inspector challenges characters to think differently.

### Grade 8
The Inspector represents Priestley's ideas. His authority forces reflection.

### Grade 9
The Inspector acts as a moral catalyst. His authority disrupts capitalist complacency. Contextually, he embodies socialist ideals. Alternatively, his ambiguity suggests ideas transcend individual authority.
